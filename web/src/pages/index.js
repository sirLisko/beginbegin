        <h2>About Us</h2>
          <div  className="box_9__text">
          <p>Charlie and Olivia met whilst training at the Actors Class. We clicked. We want to make theatre together. Join us. Follow us. Email us. Get in touch.</p>

          <p>One day at the Nash Olivia came in with a great Wordsworth quote sheâ€™d read: 'To begin, begin' . That would make a great name for our company, replied Charlie. And so our partnership was born.</p>
          
          <p>begin:begin is all about collaboration with: theatre practitioners, artists, creatives, performers, movers, shakers, storytellers, writers, directors, producers and anyone with a creative streak who has a brilliant idea and the urge to try and fail and fail better.</p>
          
          <p>Our first play Feast, written by Olivia has a cast of six women of five different nationalities. We love that cast. Feast is our beginning. Feast is a girl gang with a brilliant director who supported us wherever we went. We had no money and yet performed on the roof of the Shakespeare Theatre in Gdansk. Look it up. It's beautiful.</p>
          
          <p>We want to represent the world we live in. In all its glory and all its imperfections.</p>
          
          <p>We believe in equality. We believe in hard work. We believe in ourselves.</p>
          
          <p>We believe in the power of theatre to inspire.</p>
          
          <p>We are open.</p>
          
          <p>We have begun.</p></div>
